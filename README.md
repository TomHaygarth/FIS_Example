# FIS_Example
A Fuzzy Inference System I wrote back in 2013 while at University

## About
The FIS was put together to control simple steering behaviour of a car with the imputs being modelled
as the distance (left/right) the car was from the centre point of the road and the current turning velocity
(how much the car was turning left/right)

The FIS system would then take these inputs and produce a new turning velocity the car should use.

Each of these inputs and output would be in a range of -1.0 to 1.0. Where -1.0 Was used to denote Far or Hard
Left and 1.0 being Far or Hard Right.
